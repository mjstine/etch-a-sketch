## Introduction

Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project! This project brings the classic Etch-A-Sketch experience to your web browser. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows you to draw and create patterns on a grid-like canvas.

### Features

- Adjustable grid size (16x16 up to 64x64)
- Left-click to draw, right-click to undo
- Reset button to clear the canvas

Explore this project to see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create an interactive drawing application.
