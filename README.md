## Introduction

Welcome to the Etch-A-Sketch project! This project brings the classic Etch-A-Sketch experience to your web browser. Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the app allows you to draw and create patterns on a grid-like canvas.

### Features

- Adjustable grid size (16x16 up to 64x64)
- Left-click to draw, right-click to undo
- Reset button to clear the canvas

Explore this project to see how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create an interactive drawing application.

## What is the Etch-A-Sketch Project?

The Etch-A-Sketch project is a web application that simulates the classic Etch-A-Sketch toy digitally. It allows users to draw and create artwork on a virtual grid canvas. This project showcases the implementation of interactive features using JavaScript, enabling users to draw with different colors and sizes, adjust the grid size, and clear the canvas.

## Why I Started This Project

As a passionate developer, I embarked on the Etch-A-Sketch project to explore the creative side of web development. The idea of bringing a beloved childhood toy to the digital realm fascinated me. This project provided an opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and user interactions.

Additionally, I wanted to showcase the versatility of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in creating interactive and engaging web applications. By recreating the Etch-A-Sketch experience, I aimed to demonstrate the power of these technologies in delivering enjoyable user experiences.

## Acknowledgments

This project was made possible with the help of various resources and inspirations:

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) for the icons used in the app interface.
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/)'s curriculum for providing guidance and learning materials.

## Usage

To use the Etch-A-Sketch:

1. Open the [Live Demo](https://mjstine.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) in your web browser.
2. Enter a new grid size (between 16 and 64) using the input field and click "Enter."
3. Left-click on a cell to draw with a black color.
4. Right-click on a cell to undo the drawing.
5. Click the "Reset" button to clear the entire canvas.

The app provides a creative way to draw and experiment with patterns on a digital canvas.

### Code Overview

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the Etch-A-Sketch interface.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file defining the visual styling of the app.
- `js/app.js`: The JavaScript file implementing the drawing functionality.
